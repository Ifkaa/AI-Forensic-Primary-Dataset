AI-Based Computer Crime Investigation and Automated Reporting Framework

This repository presents an AI-based cybercrime investigation framework developed for academic research purposes. The project includes synthetic datasets representing network activity, user behavior, file metadata, and incident timelines.

An AI-based analysis component applies rule-based reasoning to correlate multiple data sources and identify suspicious cybercrime activities. Based on the analysis results, an automated report generation module produces structured cybercrime investigation reports containing incident summaries, timelines, findings, and recommendations.

The framework demonstrates how artificial intelligence techniques can support automated cybercrime investigation and reporting, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Somalia.
